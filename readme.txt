This project was written in Python 3.9.7 and pygame 2.1.2.
However, it should work with any Python 3 version and any compatible pygame version.

To install pygame, run cmd as administrator and type 'pip install pygame' (assuming you have Python installed).

To run it, download the three .py files and run main.py.
